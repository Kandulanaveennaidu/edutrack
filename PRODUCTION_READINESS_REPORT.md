## 5. Remaining Warnings (Non-blocking)

These are React hook dependency warnings — intentional patterns (mount-only data fetching) that do NOT affect functionality:

| Warning                             | File                        | Impact |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| useEffect missing fetchHistory dep  | attendance/history/page.tsx | None   |
| useEffect missing fetchStudents dep | students/page.tsx           | None   |
| useCallback missing stats dep       | visitors/page.tsx           | None   |
| useMemo dep from logical expression | sidebar.tsx                 | None   |

### Pre-deployment Requirements

- [ ] Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a strong random value
- [ ] Set `MONGODB_URI` to production cluster
- [ ] Configure `NEXTAUTH_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Set up SMTP credentials for email service
- [ ] Enable MongoDB Atlas backup
- [ ] Set up application monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Enable SSL/HTTPS

## 7. Known Limitations & Technical Debt

| Item                                         | Severity | Notes                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rate limiter is in-memory                    | Low      | Works for single-instance; use Redis for multi-instance          |
| Backup API is placeholder                    | Low      | Returns simulated data; needs real backup integration            |
| Subscription payments simulated              | Low      | No actual payment gateway; ready for Razorpay/Stripe integration |
| Transaction IDs not cryptographically secure | Low      | Using Date.now + random; fine for pilot                          |
| N+1 query in student import                  | Low      | Sequential student creation; add batch insert for large imports  |
| Hook dependency warnings                     | Info     | Intentional patterns, non-blocking                               |
